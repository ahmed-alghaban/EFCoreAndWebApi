# ProductApplication

## Project Setup

To create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project, use the following command:

```bash
dotnet new webapi -o ProductApplication
```

> **Note:** For this week's task, focus only on the Web API and LINQ. No additional libraries or EF Core are required.

## Task Overview

Build a simple Web API with the following requirements:

### Product Model

Create a `Product` entity with these properties:

- `id`
- `name`
- `description`
- `price`

### Mock Data

Generate mock data for products, similar to the approach used in the lecture.

### Services & Endpoints

Implement three endpoints:

1. **Get all products**
2. **Get a product by ID**
3. **Get products ordered by price**

Structure your files as demonstrated in the lecture.
