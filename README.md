# To create a new project you would need this command

```bash
dotnet new webapi -o ProductApplication
```

# no need for the libraries for this week's task just focus on the web api part and linq

# This weekâ€™s task would consist of the following:

# A Model for an entity called Product that would consist of

# id

# name

# description

# price

# We would create mock data based on the way we did in the lecture.

# Three services for the below endpoints to function

# Three endpoints

# 1- Get all the products in the object

# 2- Get one product based on the ID

# 3- Get the products ordered by price

# The file structure would be based on the one we did in the lecture, and no need to go into EF Core in this task, as it will be for next week.

# Learning is taking initiative. One drop could fill a bucket for some, and others need a waterfall to fill it, yet one drop is better than none.

# Good luck, and I wish you all the best.
